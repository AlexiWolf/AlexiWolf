# Hello, I'm Lexi 🐺

I've more-or-less abandoned my Github, and I've purged most of my own projects from here.  This account 
is only kept around so I can contribute to projects hosted on here, and also because crates.io still 
requires a Github account for some reason.

If you want to know more about me, you can visit my [my about page](https://lexi.wolvesin.space/about)
on my personal website.
