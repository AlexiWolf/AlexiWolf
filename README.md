# Hi There, I'm Alexi

I typically go by Lexi.

### About Me

A generalist programmer with an affinity for game development, code architecture, and back-end / library design.  I 
enjoy cracking hard problems and writing rock-solid, high-quality code while doing it.  I occasionally take on 
freelance work, and while I don't yet have much professional experience, I'm hoping to change that soon!

- I'm currently spending most of my spare time working on [Wolf Engine](https::/github.com/AlexiWolf/wolf_engine), and 
  participating in game jams.
- I'm currently learning about game engine architecture and design.
- I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects.
