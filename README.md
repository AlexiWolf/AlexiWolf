# Hello, I'm Lexi üê∫

I've abandoned my Github, and I've purged most of my work from here.  This account 
is only kept around because some things still require a Github account for some reason.

If you want to know more about me, you can visit [my website](https://lexi.wolvesin.space/).

If you want to find my work, you can see my [personal Git forge](https://git.wolvesin.space),
or my [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/AlexiWolf).
